# library
library on C++
This program reproduces the minimal functionality of a regular library; user interaction takes place through the console.
All book titles are extracted from the "names" file and IT is IMPORTANT that this file and the book files are ANSI encoded, as well as located in the same folder with the executable file of the program (that is, in the root folder)
